# What is Django Rest CLI ?
Depending on what template you pick, with this CLI tool you could scaffold your project with everything from auto-generated docs, authentication endpoints, pre-commit hooks for code linting, docker support and more. Additionally, you can just define your models and have this tool generate CRUD endpoints for each model defined with just a command.
