## What is Django Rest CLI ?
A CLI tool for _rapid_ Rest APIs development. It abstracts the repeated aspects of building a REST API with the Django Framework by:

- Allowing you start your project from one of three templates. Each template comes with features you'd most likely be setting up yourself already configured for you.

- Allowing you define your models and have this tool generate CRUD endpoints for each model defined.
For example, if you define a model, **Product** in your `models.py` file, this tool could generate a _GET /products POST /products PUT /products/<product_id>_ etc. endpoints for that model.

- Allowing you create all the apps in your project at once, if you know them before hand.

## Getting Started

### Installation
```pip install dr-cli```

I highly recommend that you install this in a virtual environment.

### Create a New Project
- Run ```dr-cli startproject project_name``` to start a new DRF project.

- You'd be prompted to start your project from one of three templates: **Basic, Medior, and Advanced** templates. Learn more about what each template comes bundled with [here](https://github.com/py-universe/django-rest-cli/blob/docs/templatesInfo.md).

- On selecting one of the templates your project will then be created. Git will be initialized in your project, and all project dependencies installed as shown in the image below:

The generated project comes with a nice Readme containing the steps for running the project


### Create New Apps in your Project
- Run ```dr-cli startapps todo me-nu user``` to create multiple Django apps in your project. Where `todo me-nu user` are your app names.

- Running the above command will create all your apps. Name validations would also be performed as shown in the image below:

**Note** Make sure to add your created apps to the list of INSTALLED APPS


### Generate CRUD Endpoints for your Apps
- Run ```dr-cli addcrud memo user``` to create CRUD endpoints for the models defined in the specified apps. 

- Running the above command would return a nice looking feedback as shown in the image below:

**Note** Make sure to register the `URLs` for each app in the top level `urls.py` file.

On Windows, Emojis are only supported in [Windows Terminal Preview](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal-preview/9n8g5rfz9xk3?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)

### Accessing the docs page
- Run `python manage.py runserver` to fire up your local development server, and point your browser to `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/docs` to view the auto-generated docs page shown in the image below:

## Motivation
I've documented my motivation for working on this tool [here](https://dev.to/nyior/dr-cli-a-flexible-cookie-cutter-and-crud-endpoints-generator-for-django-2nlb).


## Contributing Guide
Coming soon... 


## Acknowledgements
In building this I re-used a few parts of these repositories in this project:
- [django-classy-start](https://github.com/mfonism/django-classy-start)
- [dr-scaffold](https://github.com/Abdenasser/dr_scaffold)


## I Love this, how can I thank you Nyior?
Please let your developer friends know about this repo :) If you star this repo too I won't complain xD

## Limitations
Python310 isn't supported in this project yet. We are working on it.
