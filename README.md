## What is Django Rest CLI ?
A CLI tool for _rapid_ Rest APIs development with the Django Framework.
It abstracts the repeated aspects of building a REST API with the Django Rest Framework by:

- Allowing you start your project from one of three templates. Each template comes with features you'd most likely be setting up yourself already configured.

- Allowing you define your models and have this tool generate CRUD endpoints for each model defined.
For example, if you define a model, **Product** in your `models.py` file, this tool could generate a _GET /products POST /products PUT /products/<product_id>_ etc. endpoints for that model.

- Allowing you create all the apps in your project at once, if you know them before hand.

### Installation

### CLI Commands
###### `startproject project_name`

###### `startapps app1_name app2_name app3_name`

###### `addcrud app1_name app2_name app3_name`

## Motivation
In creating REST APIs with the Django framework, I noticed there were things I kept repeating for every project. And there were things I just wished there was a better way of doing them. I created this CLI tool to address _the three concerns_ that mattered to me the most. Hopefully, it resonates with you too.

- **PROBLEM-1:**  I noticed I was repeating at least one of the following integrations, and features in every project:
  - A custom user model defined in a `users` app
  - Authentication endpoints.
  - [python-decouple](https://pypi.org/project/python-decouple/): for managing environment varibales 
  - [drf-spactacular](https://drf-spectacular.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html): for auto-generating APi docs 
  - [dj-database-url](https://github.com/jazzband/dj-database-url): for connecting to various databases 
  - [pre-commit, black, isort, flake8](https://ljvmiranda921.github.io/notebook/2018/06/21/precommits-using-black-and-flake8/): for code linting with pre-commit hooks 
  - [pytest-django](https://pytest-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): for writing unit tests with pytest 
  - [Docker](https://learndjango.com/tutorials/django-docker-and-postgresql-tutorial): for containerization. 

  So I wished there was a tool that could start my project with the integrations, and features I need configured. I found [cookie-cutter-django-rest](https://github.com/agconti/cookiecutter-django-rest) to be useful, but sometimes it's just too heavy for my use-case. I needed something more flexible, something that could start my project with few integrations or all the features and integrations above. 

  - **SOLUTION:** This CLI tool allows you start your project from one of three templates we provide: Basic, Medior, and Advanced templates. Depending on what template you select, you could scaffold your project with just python_decouple for managing env vars. Or you could go with something as complex as adding pytest for unit tests, drf_spectacular for auto-generating docs, authentication endpoints, pre-commit hook for code linting setup in your project, and docker support. Regardless of the template you select, we initialize git, and add a readme to your project.


- **PROBLEM-2:** I noticed most times I needed CRUD endpoints for the models I define. CRUD endpoints are so unchanging that I wish there was a tool that could just generate all the CRUD endpoints for the models I define.

  - **SOLUTION:** You can define your models and have this tool generate CRUD endpoints for each model defined. For example, if you define a model, **Product** in your `models.py` file, this tool could generate a _GET /products POST /products PUT /products/<product_id>_ etc. endpoints for that model.


- **PROBLEM-3:** I had always wish there was a way to create multiples apps at once in my Django project
  - **SOLUTION:** This tool allows you create multiple apps at once in this project.

## Acknowledgements
In building this I found the following repositories _really_ helpful.
In fact I re-used few parts of these repositories in this project:
- [django-classy-start](https://github.com/mfonism/django-classy-start)
- [dr-scaffold](https://github.com/Abdenasser/dr_scaffold)


## I Love this, how can I thank you Nyior?
Just let your developer friends know about this repo :) If you star this repo too I won't complain xD
